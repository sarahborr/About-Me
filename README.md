# Summary
Hello! My name is Sarah. I am a 17 year old senior, currently taking classes such as AP chemisty and sociology. In my free time I like to draw and. on occasion, watch Netflix. My favorite videogames are [Overwatch]() and [Minecraft](), but I do also play a lot of 2048 and [Tetris](). 
# Family
My family consists of my mom, grandma, and two sisters. My mom is a scientist who is a part-time college student working towards her masters. At night, my grandmother works as a nurses aid, and during the day she watches me and my sisters. 
I am the oldest sibling. My youngest sister is a 7th grader who goes to Plouffe, and my other sister is an 11th grader who goes to BHS.
